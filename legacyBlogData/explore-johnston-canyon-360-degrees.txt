<div><p>Exploring the thundering falls and icy cliffs of <a href="/johnston-canyon">Johnston Canyon</a> make this classic winter hike a must-do experience for every visit to Banff National Park. </p>
<p>The trailhead is located just east of Castle Junction on the Bow Valley Parkway (Hwy-1A). From there, hike 2.5 km (one-way) to the upper falls or 1.2 km (one-way) to the lower falls. Leave yourself about two hours to complete the loop and to give yourself plenty of time for photos. </p>
<p>Joining a guided ice walk is an amazing way to learn all about the history of this natural wonder. For a different perspective, consider joining a night excursion.
