<div><p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Whether winding the day down or getting the night started, enjoying a bevy at any of Banff’s lively and charismatic pubs is an essential component to any great day in the mountains. The pub scene is as much a part of Banff National Park culture as the adventure that draws so many here. After all, climbing up a peak or skiing down a slope just wouldn’t be the same if it weren’t celebrated at the end of the day. </b></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Banff Avenue Brewing Co.</b></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Whether you’re getting together with a big group or want a more close-up-and-personal setting, <a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Banff Avenue Brew Pub" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="1989" href="http://www.banffavebrewingco.ca" target="_blank">Banff Avenue Brew Pub </a>has the table for you. Their beer features a wide selection of locally-attributed beers, from lagers to stouts, including a rotating seasonal tap or two. </b></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Elk and Oarsman</b></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">You’ll hardly notice a difference between the <a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Elk &amp; Oarsman Pub &amp; Grill" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2267" href="https://elkandoarsman.com/" target="_blank">Elk and Oarsman</a> and any Rockies ski lodge. Canadian decor, stone fireplace, and a high-ceilinged timber interior all exude the cozy apr</b><strong>è</strong><b>s feel. In the summer, you can enjoy a drink with 360-degree views from their rooftop patio. </b></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Tommy’s</b></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">A visit to <a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Tommy's Neighbourhood Pub" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2185" href="http://tommysneighbourhoodpub.com/" target="_blank">Tommy’s</a> has remained the same now as the good old days. You can bet on mingling with locals, cheap drinks (and pub food) to begin the night, and a short walk to any of Banff’s nightclubs - one is right next door. It’s also a hub for jam nights and live sets from local musicians.</b></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Rose and Crown</b></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">If there was a ‘business in the front, party in the back’ for pubs, the <a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Rose &amp; Crown" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2038" href="http://www.roseandcrown.ca" target="_blank">Rose &amp; Crown</a> would be it - sort of. Good times are guaranteed to be had throughout the entire pub, but while the back pool table and jukebox lend to the fun crowds, the front dining area and live music often catch up in no time. </b></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">St. James Gate</b></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">The most classic pub that you’ll find in Banff, in true Irish fashion. In fact, it was built in Dublin, Ireland itself! With its imported Irish woodwork and artifacts, <a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="St. James's Gate Olde Irish Pub" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2069" href="http://www.stjamesgatebanff.com" target="_blank">St. James's Gate Olde Irish Pub</a> transports you back in time. Enjoy several beers on tap from England and Ireland, as well as an extensive Whiskey selection. </b></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6">Devil’s Gap</b></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-4e98e6c8-fe98-542f-ad9a-423038b522a6"><a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Devil's Gap" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2161" href="https://www.facebook.com/thedevilsgap/" target="_blank">The Devil’s Gap</a> is often the halfway point as a night out escalates from pub to club. It’s a chameleon when it comes to the Banff bar scene. Come early enough to enjoy a game of foosball and catch up with friends over a Pabst, but wander in beyond 10 pm and it’ll transform into a shoulder-to-shoulder party. </b></p>
