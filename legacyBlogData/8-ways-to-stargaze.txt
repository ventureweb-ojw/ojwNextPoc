<div><p>The air is crisp as you venture to the lakeside, carefully walking by the light of a headlamp. Snow crunches underfoot as you dig your boots in, take in the stillness, then <em>click. </em>Off goes the headlamp. Gazing up into the darkness, you’ve never seen so many stars. The sky is filled with celestial wonders so clearly defined that in an instant Banff National Park has redefined the idea of stargazing.</p>
<p>Having little to no light pollution, the Banff and Lake Louise region offers the rare opportunity to view the stars under some of the darkest skies on the planet. Not only will it awaken the kid in you, but stargazing, however you like to do it, gives you a chance to escape the ordinary and put life into perspective.</p>
<p>So bundle up and get out there! Here are 8 ways you can stargaze in Banff National Park:</p>
<h4>1. Low-Effort Stargazing</h4>
<p>A memorable experience under the dark skies can be as simple as looking up. For a quick jaunt close to Banff, try <a href="/vermilion-lakes">Vermilion Lakes</a>, <a href="/lake-minnewanka">Lake Minnewanka</a> or Two Jack Lake. For the darkest skies take a journey up the <a href="/icefields-parkway">Icefields Parkway</a>! We recommend Bow Lake, which offers parking and a quick hike to the lakeshore.</p>

<h4>8. Lantern Tours at Cave and Basin</h4>
<p>Hosted partially inside (though still very dark!) and outside, the Lantern Tours at the <a data-gtm_category="Activities" data-gtm_event_value="3.9000" data-gtm_label="Cave &amp; Basin National Historic Site" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Arts, Culture &amp; Heritage" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2496" href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/cave" target="_blank">Cave and Basin National Historic Site</a> will give you a new appreciation for our national parks system. By lantern light you’ll enter the cave and make your way up the tunnel to a hidden pool. Stop by Story Hall to learn more about this impressive site, then don’t miss the greatest secret: step out on the old pool deck for some unexpected stargazing right on the outskirts of town.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus!</strong> The Northern Lights frequently make an appearance overhead in Banff National Park. If you're lucky, they'll be active and you'll have clear skies to see them. The goal is to find views predominantly north, so Lake Minnewanka is a great go-to spot for starters!
