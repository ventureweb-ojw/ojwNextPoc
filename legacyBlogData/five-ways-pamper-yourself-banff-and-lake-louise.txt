<div><p>Canada’s first national park has plenty of activities to fill your days, but sometimes all those breathtaking moments leave you wanting to slow down and relax. You’re on vacation, after all— why not treat yourself. Sink even further into your Rocky Mountain experience by adding a little luxury to your stay. Here are four ways to pamper yourself while in Banff National Park.</p>
<h4>Banff Upper Hot Springs</h4>
<p>The reason the park even exists as a national treasure at all is because of the legendary <a data-gtm_category="Spa &amp; Wellness" data-gtm_event_value="7.3000" data-gtm_label="Banff Upper Hot Springs" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Day Spas" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2330" href="http://www.hotsprings.ca/banff" target="_blank">Banff Upper Hot Springs.</a> The mineral waters, said to have healing properties that have long attracted visitors to the area, are the perfect way to get into the Banff experience. Nestled at the bottom of Sulphur Mountain, the outdoor pool hovers around 40 degrees Celsius naturally, which makes for an extra treat during cold winter evenings after a day on the slopes, the hiking trail, or strolling downtown. The unbeatable mountain view doesn’t hurt either.</p>
<h4>Experience the spa</h4>
<p>If you didn’t get your fill of the water at the hot springs, make your way to one of serval amazing spas in Banff and Lake Louise, where you can spend the day enjoying an invigorating and relaxing experience. Follow up your dip with your spa’s signature massage or facial experiences to truly reset.
