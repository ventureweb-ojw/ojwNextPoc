<div><p>The iconic howl of the train horn in the station greets travellers as they embark on the trip of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Countless goosebump moments over a two-day journey on one of the world's most luxurious train rides are complimented with knowledgeable commentary and exquisite service from the carriage staff. Visiting Banff comes in no classier, exclusive, or symbolic fashion than on the world-famous <a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Rocky Mountaineer Vacations" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Travel Operators &amp; Agents" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2035" href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com" target="_blank">Rocky Mountaineer</a>. </p>
<p>Banff was built on tourism via the Canadian Pacific Railway - a symbol of Canadian history that united the country and rides the same rails today. This train is true to the past - luxurious service accompanied by vibrant and unparalleled scenery that dazzles guests the same way it has for over a century. Granted, perhaps 360-degree glass dome cars and heated seats may not have been available back then, but the experience remains the same.   </p>

<p>Taking off from the station in Banff, it wasn't more than 45 minutes later that our carriage spotted a bear and moments later, an elk - and this in addition to the turquoise waters, glacier-capped peaks, and historical landmarks like Morant's Curve that surround the rails. </p>

<p>An aspect that creates an even more unforgettable experience is the staff - it cannot be highlighted enough how educational and attentive their service is. You have questions? They have answers. Which mountain is that? What year was that established? How did that happen? They have all the answers, with smiles, while delivering your bottomless beverages, if you wish.  </p>

<p>Shortly after departure, guests are invited to the dining car for breakfast - wild salmon eggs benedict, Canadian maple bacon french toast, and so on. Be it breakfast or lunch, the Rocky Mountaineer is a culinary experience you won't forget. The food and beverages are included with your journey and selected from a menu that will leave you wishing for it all. Wine from British Columbia, craft beers, and spirits create an even more memorable journey offering some of the best refreshments that Western Canada has to offer. </p>
<p>Shortly after crossing the border into Yoho National Park, the train twists and turns through the spiral tunnels - an engineering marvel of its time. Tunnel after tunnel, the train descends into Kicking Horse Canyon as the glacial waters race along next to it. Making your way westbound into the Pacific Time Zone, the train ascends Rogers Pass, and even past the place where the first Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, drove the last spike into the uniting transcontinental railway.</p>
