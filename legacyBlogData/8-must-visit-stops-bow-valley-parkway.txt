<div><p>The Bow Valley Parkway (Hwy-1A) offers something for every visitor to Banff National Park. Excellent road cycling, world-class hiking or even just a quiet spot to have a picnic lunch. </p>
<p>This 50 km scenic route runs parallel to the Trans-Canada highway, offering a great alternative drive to connect Banff and Lake Louise.  </p>
<p>Here are 8 must-visit stops along this classic drive: </p>
<h4>1. The Sawback Burn  </h4>
<p>Our first stop isn’t so much a stop as it is a point of interest. Shortly after turning on to the Bow Valley Parkway (around the 4 km point) heading west, you’ll notice a large previously burned area of forest - the remnants of the prescribed Sawback burn of 1993. </p>
<p>“Wait, they set that fire on purpose?”, you might say. </p>
<p>The answer is yes! As unusual as it may seem, fire is a very important part of the ecosystem in Banff National Park. The burned areas quickly spring to life and offer new space for plants and wildlife. This is a great place to watch for bears, bighorn sheep, and elk. </p>
<h4>2. Muleshoe </h4>
<p>If you’re in search of a picnic spot, consider a stop at Muleshoe. This turn-off (around the 5.2 km point headed west) has a number of picnic tables, washroom facilities and a wonderful bird habitat. Bring your binoculars and watch for Pileated Woodpeckers, Osprey, and more.  </p>

<h4>3. Johnston Canyon  </h4>
<p>An essential part of any visit to Banff National Park should include a stop at <a href="/johnston-canyon">Johnston Canyon</a>. This incredible feature shows the beauty of natural sculpture at work. Follow an elevated catwalk through the canyon and watch as thundering falls carve the ancient limestone cliffs. Those looking for a quick stop can travel 1.2 km to the lower falls viewpoint, while more adventurous hikers can continue on a further 1.2 km to the upper falls. If you’d like to make a day of it, start early and continue up to<a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Parks Canada" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Community &amp; Government" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2548" href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/activ/randonee-hiking/banff#inkpots" target="_blank"> The Ink Pots</a> - a colourful array of mineral springs which lies 10.8 km from the trailhead. </p>
<p><strong>Local’s Tip:</strong> Parking is limited and in demand during the summer months, so go early (before 8 a.m.) or take the <a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Parks Canada" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Community &amp; Government" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2548" href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/visit/parkbus/banff" target="_blank">public shuttle</a> to ensure you get a spot.  </p>
<h4>4. Rockbound Lake  </h4>
<p>Just before Castle Junction, you’ll find the trailhead for <a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Parks Canada" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Community &amp; Government" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2548" href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/activ/randonee-hiking/banff#rockbound" target="_blank">Rockbound Lake</a> - a moderate day hike which climbs 8.4 km (760 m elevation gain) through lush forest to a stunning glacial cirque. There are two great bonuses to this trip. First, peel off the trail at a junction 700 m in to visit Silverton Falls, a hidden gem. The second bonus is the tiny, but picturesque Tower Lake, located below Castle Mountain. Make sure to bring a camera along for this stop. </p>
<h4>5. Storm Mountain Lookout </h4>
<p>Another great picnic spot along the Bow Valley Parkway is the Storm Mountain Lookout. Here you’ll find a handful of picnic tables above the beautiful Bow River. The interpretive signage does a great job of outlining the ridgeline, so leave yourself some time to check it out. </p>
<h4>6. Castle Lookout  </h4>
<p>Previously home to a crucial fire lookout beneath the cliffs of Castle Mountain, the <a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Parks Canada" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Community &amp; Government" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2548" href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/activ/randonee-hiking/1A#castle" target="_blank">Castle Lookout trail</a> offers hikers a stunning view of the Bow Valley. Leave yourself 3 - 4 hours for the 7.4 km (540 m elevation gain) round-trip. For an interesting take on the trip, consider joining Great Divide Nature Interpretation for <a data-gtm_category="Activities" data-gtm_event_value="74.0000" data-gtm_label="Great Divide Nature Interpretation" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Outdoor Recreation" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2302" href="https://www.greatdivide.ca/fondue/" target="_blank">“Fondue with a view”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Local's Tip: </strong><a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Castle Mountain Chalets" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2346" href="http://www.castlemountain.com" target="_blank">Castle Mountain Chalets</a> is located roughly half-way down the parkway and doubles as a gas station if the tank is running low. It's a great spot to grab a snack or to stay at for a relaxing retreat.</p>
<h4>7. Baker Creek Mountain Resort </h4>
<p>Another classic stop for cyclists and adventurers is <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="250.0000" data-gtm_label="Baker Creek Mountain Resorts" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="1981" href="http://www.bakercreek.com" target="_blank">The Baker Creek Mountain Resort.</a> This cozy cabin resort is also home to a <a data-gtm_category="Food &amp; Beverage" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Baker Creek Bistro" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Bar &amp; Restaurant" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2782" href="http://bakercreek.com/Baker-Creek-Bistro/" target="_blank">full-service bistro,</a> along with a small creekside cafe. If you’d like to spend a few days exploring The Bow Valley Parkway, consider making this your home base with a dine and stay package.   </p>

<h4>8. Morant’s Curve  </h4>
<p>Named for famed CPR photographer Nicolas Morant, this spot is one of the most photographed spots in Banff National Park. Time it right and watch as the rail line and the Bow River snake in front of the rising peaks of Mt. Temple, Fairview Mountain, and more. </p>
