<div><p>Picture yourself speeding through the Alberta wilderness while tucked in a sled powered by a team of furry friends. It’s cold and crisp, the snow is falling, and every direction brings a breathtaking view. Or maybe you’ve got the reins in your hands, learning to “mush” with the best of them, harnessing the power of a sleek team of huskies.</p>
<p><a href="/dog-sledding">Dog sledding</a> is one of those special activities you can’t do just anywhere. Luckily, in Banff and Lake Louise, there are many options for you and your family and friends to get the true “powder hound” experience. Check out some of the different tours available, and what they have to offer. </p>
