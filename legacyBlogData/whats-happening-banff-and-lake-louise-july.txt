<p><meta content="uuid0IL0KKQHAaOX" name="uuid"/><meta charset="utf-8"/></p>
<p>As of July 1, a small portion of the Bow Valley Parkway (Castle Junction to the Johnston Canyon trailhead) has reopened for vehicle access. Visitors can now enjoy 30 km of scenic driving (Lake Louise to Johnston Canyon).</p>
<p>Public transit is now <a href="https://roamtransit.com/schedules-routes/summer-johnston-canyon-route-nine/" target="_blank">reservable</a> and highly recommended when visiting Johnston Canyon as parking is extremely limited. </p>
<p>Visitors can also still enjoy 17 km of cycling from the Fireside Day Use area to Johnston Canyon as this portion of the parkway remains closed to public vehicles. This is one of the best ways to experience the parkway, as you ride at a leisurely pace and enjoy the spectacular scenery.</p>
