<div><p>Crisp air filters through your lungs as you climb, one step at a time, through the peace and quiet of the forest. Snow crunching underfoot, you make your way higher, then take a moment to look up. The view has opened up, revealing a sea of peaks blanketed in snow, shining brilliantly under a blue-bird sky. </p>
<p>It’s on winter days like this that sometimes the best way to experience Banff National Park is on your two feet. So, when the snow starts to fly, keep your hiking boots handy! With a few extra pieces of gear, you can comfortably venture to some of the same destinations as you can in the summertime. </p>
<h4>Here’s the lowdown:</h4>
<p><b>Stay Safe (And Keep Your Socks Dry!)</b></p>
<p>For winter hiking, I recommend three pieces of equipment that will make the experience safe and enjoyable. Can’t bring it with you? Great news is, you can rent this gear from local stores, such as <a data-gtm_category="Retail" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Snowtips-Bactrax Ski &amp; Bike Rental" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Sporting goods &amp; Apparel" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2063" href="http://www.snowtips-bactrax.com" target="_blank">Snowtips-Bactrax</a> and <a data-gtm_category="Activities" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Banff Adventures" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Sightseeing &amp; Tours" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="1985" href="https://www.banffadventures.com" target="_blank">Banff Adventures</a> in Banff and <a data-gtm_category="Retail" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Wilson Mountain Sports" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Sporting goods &amp; Apparel" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2467" href="http://www.wmsll.com" target="_blank">Wilson Mountain Sports</a> in Lake Louise!</p>
<p><b>Micro-spikes: </b>You’ll be surprised just how grippy these are on hard-packed snow and ice.</p>
<p><b>Gaiters:</b> Keep snow out of your boots and your feet will stay warm and dry.</p>
<p><b>Hiking Poles:</b> Don’t make your legs do all the work! Get your upper body involved and you’ll save a ton of energy.</p>

<h3><b>Want to try it for yourself? </b></h3>
<p>Here are a few easy hikes to get you started. </p>
<h4><b>Johnston Canyon</b></h4>
<p><strong>Distance</strong>: 1.2 km one way to the Lower Falls </p>
<p><strong>Distance</strong>: 2.5 km one way to the Upper Falls </p>
<p><strong>Start at</strong>: Johnston Canyon parking lot on the Bow Valley Parkway.</p>
<p>A bubbling canyon with surging waterfalls in summer, Johnston Canyon turns into an icy paradise when the temperatures plummet. Choose from two short hikes to some of Banff’s most accessible (frozen) waterfalls. </p>
<p>In the meantime, strap on a pair of cleats and join us on a 360 degree walk-through tour of Johnston Canyon Lower Falls. Use your mouse or (swipe around on your mobile) to explore the area. Click on waypoints to move throughout the canyon.</p>

<h4><b>Tunnel Mountain</b></h4>
<p><strong>Distance</strong>: 2.4 km one way </p>
<p><strong>Start at</strong>: Tunnel Mountain trailhead parking lot on St. Julien Road</p>
<p>This trail switchbacks its way up the side of Banff’s “Sleeping Buffalo”, starting slightly more steeply, then easing off. From the top, you’ve got a great view of the Town of Banff, as well as the surrounding peaks.</p>
<h4>Hoodoos Viewpoint</h4>
<p><strong>Distance</strong>: 2.3 km one way on Douglas Fir trail to Hoodoos viewpoint </p>
<p><strong>Distance</strong>: 4.8 km one way from Surprise Corner to Hoodoos viewpoint </p>
<p><strong>Start at</strong>: Either the intersection of Tunnel Mountain Road and Tunnel Mountain Drive or<i> </i>Surprise Corner parking lot on Tunnel Mountain Drive </p>
<p>You’ve got two ways to get to the Hoodoos, Banff’s famous geological wonders. Both trails to these spires of eroded rock are scenic, but offer different views of the area just surrounding the Town of Banff.</p>
