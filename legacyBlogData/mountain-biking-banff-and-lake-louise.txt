<h4>Essential Gear</h4>
<p>If you’re heading out on the trails be sure to bring ample water, some light snacks, and an extra layer just in case. A multi-tool, spare tube, and pump are always recommended to help you get back in the event of a puncture. Plenty of folks are willing to lend a hand and fix a flat if you have the supplies to get the job done.</p>
<h4>Wildlife Safety and Trail Etiquette</h4>
<p>Do your part to protect our trails, the animals, and the environment that surrounds them. If you pack it in then you must take it back out with you, even if it’s organic waste. Remain on the marked trails and obey all posted signs and trail closures. Always yield to hikers and horseback riders, and slow down when approaching others.</p>
<p>Bear and other animal encounters are also important to be aware of. Always carry bear spray and it is recommended to ride in groups for safety. Keep your eyes peeled and make lots of noise so that you do not surprise a bear or other animals.</p>
