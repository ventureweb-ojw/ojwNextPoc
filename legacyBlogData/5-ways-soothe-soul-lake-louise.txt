<div><p>For many of us, life moves at a fast pace. Our day-to-day grind leaves little room for rejuvenation. It takes solid intention to break free from the hustle, and there are many ways to do it. Some people turn to the serenity of nature; others dive into yoga or meditation.</p>
<p>In Lake Louise, you can do both. Here’s how:</p>
<h4><b>1. Go for Gold</b></h4>
<p><b> </b>As the excitement of summer begins to slow, Lake Louise begins to transform. Leaves and needles turn to a brilliant golden hue before falling to the ground. The changing seasons give us a reason to pause and reflect, and no matter where you go, you’re sure to find some inspiration. Enjoy the fall colours on one of the <a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="18.0000" data-gtm_label="Crowfoot Media" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Print &amp; Publication" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2667" href="https://crowfootmedia.com/2015/09/01/8-larch-hikes-canadian-rockies/" target="_blank">many hikes</a> that leave from Lake Louise or Moraine Lake, including Larch Valley, Eiffel Lake and Saddleback Pass (note that in peak larch season, you can expect a fair amount of people to be as excited about the fall colours as you are!). Consider <a href="/blog/outdoor-classroom-guided-hikes-banff-and-lake-louise">hiring an interpretive guide</a> to take your hike to the next level.  </p>

<h4><b>2. Join a Retreat</b></h4>
<p>Nestled on the picturesque shore of its namesake lake, the <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2474" href="http://www.fairmont.com/lake-louise/" target="_blank">Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise</a> offers an abundance of <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2474" href="https://www.fairmont.com/lake-louise/special-offers/hotel-offers/special-events/yoga-wellness-retreats/" target="_blank">wellness programs </a>to help you unwind and refocus. Through the fall and winter, cozy up, breathe deeply and centre yourself with your choice of retreats focusing on a number of areas: yoga, mindful eating, meditation, personal growth and positive wellbeing. You’re in good hands with the experts guiding these experiences. Find the current offerings <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2474" href="https://www.fairmont.com/lake-louise/special-offers/hotel-offers/special-events/yoga-wellness-retreats/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hint: Pinterest-ers should also check out their <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2474" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/fairmontcll/wellness-in-lake-louise/" target="_blank">Wellness Board</a>!</p>
<h4><b>3. Elevate Yourself</b></h4>
<p>If your hiking boots are calling you higher, follow them! In addition to the many hikes in the area, you can enjoy a few peaks near Lake Louise that give that birds-eye view and put life into perspective. Before the snow flies, the Big Beehive, Fairview Mountain, Saddle Peak and Mount Saint Piran are all easy to moderately difficult objectives that provide amazing views and a mental challenge, too. Take some time on the summit to be still and take it all in before hiking back down. I promise some time spent high up is good food for the soul.</p>
<p>Make sure you’re well-equipped for any peak-bagging adventures by bringing the proper gear and attire, venturing out with friends you trust in the outdoors, and having the right <a data-gtm_category="Services" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Parks Canada" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Community &amp; Government" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2548" href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/activ/randonee-hiking/lakelouise" target="_blank">trail information</a> on hand. I recommend <i>Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies, Classic Hikes in the Canadian Rockies</i> and <i>Canadian Rockies Trail Guide. </i></p>

<h4><b>4. Book a Spa Day</b></h4>
<p>After a day outdoors with larch needles gathering in your socks, you may be looking for a chance to really pamper yourself…indoors. If extreme relaxation is in the cards for you, book a treatment (or two!) at the <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2474" href="https://www.fairmont.com/lake-louise/special-offers/spa-offers/" target="_blank">Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise spa</a>. Services range from relaxing foot massages to body scrubs, facials and more. A spa day is <i>always</i> a good idea.  </p>
<p>Just steps away from Lake Louise, guests of <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Deer Lodge" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2369" href="https://bll.fyi/y65l" target="_blank">Deer Lodge</a> will love the rooftop jacuzzi for relaxing after a long day in the mountains!  </p>
<h4><b>5. Tap into Creativity</b></h4>
<p>Interpreting nature through art brings us into the present moment, makes us keenly aware of our environment and also gives us a keepsake to take home and remind us of our time in the mountains. Bring your own art supplies or camera on your visit to Lake Louise or look into <a data-gtm_category="Accommodation" data-gtm_event_value="1" data-gtm_label="Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise" data-gtm_no_track="N" data-gtm_subcategory="Hotels, Hostels &amp; Inns" data-gtm_trigger="website" data-memberid="2474" href="https://www.lakelouisewellness.com/transformative-wellness-retreat" target="_blank">a wellness retreat</a> that will help you nurture your creative side. Or, if writing is your forte bring along a paper and pen. You never know when inspiration will strike.</p>
