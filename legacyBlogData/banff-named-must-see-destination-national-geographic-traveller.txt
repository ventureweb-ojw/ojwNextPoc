<div><p><em>National Geographic Traveller</em> has named Banff and Lake Louise one of its “<a href="https://www.nationalgeographicpartners.com/press/2016/11/best-of-the-world-list/" target="_blank">Best of the World</a>” destinations for 2017. </p>
<p>Banff was the only Canadian destination named to the 2017 feature which was selected from a competitive list nominated by editors, writers, and National Geographic explorers.</p>
<p>For National Geographic writer Norie Quintos, the inspiration drawn from Banff and Lake Louise is rooted in the Canadian spirit.</p>
<p>"I found Banff to be a breath of fresh air, and emblematic of the entire country in many ways. Its first and most iconic national park is an example of an evolving relationship with nature and nature's first stewards, the First Nations peoples. And its influx and embrace of immigrants demonstrates the best of the Canadian spirit."</p>
<p>During your visit to Banff and Lake Louise, you may find yourself paddling across the turquoise waters of an iconic mountain lake or watching the last rays of light dance across a glacier, reimagining your place in the world.  </p>
<p>This place is alive. </p>
<p>Are you?  </p>
